## Social-Buzz-Analytics

This is Accenture Data Analytics virtual experience project with Forage. The goal was to help a company named "Social Buzz" leverage the use of their massive amount of data. Social Buzz has reached huge scale in recent years to become recognized as a global unicorn company. At Accenture, we have embarked on a 3 month pilot to help tackle their biggest challenges on 3 main tasks:

1- Audit of Social Buzz big data practice

2- Implimentation of an IPO

3- Analysis of top 5 pupular categories content

* Business Problem * : The client has experienced rapid growth in recent years, resulting in a significant increase in their operations. However, they lack the necessary internal resources to manage and handle this scale effectively. 

* My Job Role *: I am the data analyst assigned to analyse the client's sample data sets, generate insights, prepare visualizations and prepare a presentation to the client.
